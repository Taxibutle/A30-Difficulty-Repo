# A30-Difficulty-Repo
The Github page for the A30 Difficulty mod in KeeperRL, please read the license when using any of my code (basically just state source, use same license,, other than that do whatever)

## So, this repo is here for many reasons. 
### First, to make sure my mod gets updated to new dev builds 
### Second, easy playtesting without ruining the mod for others on steam 
### Third, people can suggest things to add and put the code in, and also submit bug reports that might not be seen in steam
